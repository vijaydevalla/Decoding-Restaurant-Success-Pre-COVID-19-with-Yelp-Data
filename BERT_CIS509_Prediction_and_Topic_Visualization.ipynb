tragic pot last time pleasant experience come back called morning make reservation roommate birthday woman phone gave reservation pm two seems well car trouble arriving call restaurant ahead time let know half hour late man phone tell yesterday dont take reservation party reservation wouldnt honored anyway ridiculous also assures two people wont much wait arrive take u minute even find someone put name rather putting ipad outside front restaurant someone carrying around man spoke phone assume manager reiterated reservation would honored anyhow roommate chinese doesnt look typically could understand mandarin spoken employee guest inferred based dialogue preferential treatment given chinese guest time waited watched hispanic family wait list long time check multiple time seated werent though table roommate noted rather clean empty table family server kept servicig table appeared chinese patron unfriendly environment made want avoid eating altogether food good personally think ridiculous charge thing like green onion garlic also didnt bring u sauce asked though provided table wont returning coworker found place santa barbara work realized hot pot definitely craving work event got thursday night around seated right away since two u upon looking menu confused af order custom bowl price topping much topping much confusion thursday night took look yelp understood order
